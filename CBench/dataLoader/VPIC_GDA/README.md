This loader will load an array of binary data. 
This loader will allow you to read and write any binary file in parallel. It uses MPIIO

Infomration about the size and tpe needs to be specified in a .info file. The binary file should have .gda as extension (becasue VPIC uses that and the first loaded was built for VPIC data)
