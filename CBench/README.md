# CBench
This is the compression benchmark arm of Foresight. It can be run on its own or part of the Foresight workflow.

## Prerequisites:
* CMake 3.8.1 or higher
* GCC 6.4 or higher (C++14 minimum)
* OpenMPI 2 or higher


## Code Fomat
* Indentation: indentation is tabs of size 4
* Default bracket style: [Allman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style)
* Varible naming: CamelCase + use meaningful variable names


## Building:
The folder **[_scripts_](scripts)** contains scripts to load modules on Cooley @ ANL and Darwin @ LANL . These build a base version of CBench:
```
git clone https://github.com/lanl/VizAly-Foresight.git

cd VizAly-Foresight
source buildDependencies.sh 
source build.sh
```

For more options, run buildDependencies.sh and build.sh with  "-h" 


## Running:
```
cd build/
mpirun -np 2 ./CBench ../inputs/hacc/hacc_cbench_test.json
cat metrics_hacc_test_.csv
```
**Note:**  The above will only run a toy dataset meant for testing if the code runs. The results should **NOT** be used as an indicator for the performance of the compressors!


# Usage
CBench takes as input a json file (examples of input json files are in the **_[inputs](inputs)_** folder) that specifies the input parameters.

### Currently Supported file formats:
* [GenericIO](https://trac.alcf.anl.gov/projects/genericio)
